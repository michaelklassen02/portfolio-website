            <p>
                I am a graduate from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering, and I am now looking for my first long-term job in software engineering. I'm interested in a variety of fields, but my specialty is in web development. I have a lot of practice in frontend web design and would love to help design new and compelling websites for your company.
